<h2>Governments</h2>

<p class="intro">We built Open Civic Data to make it easier for you and your constituents to share information about local government online. Using Open Civic Data speeds integration of your data with local and national applications, making it possible for the first time to compare governments across the country. Open Civic Data empowers internet-scale tools to work in everyone's hometown.</p>

    <h3>What is Open Civic Data?</h3>
    <p>Open Civic Data is a way to structure local legislative information that provides greater interoperability and searchability. Open Civic Data powers Google's Civic Information API with unique identifiers and was created by the expert team who created Open States.</p>
    <p>Open Civic Data can work along side your local legislative systems or power new legislative software apps.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://openstates.org/">Open States</a></h3>
    <p><a href="http://openstates.org/">Open States</a> is a project created by the Sunlight Foundation that collects and publishes legislative information, from all 50 states, Puerto Rico and D.C. This project inspired the work for the Open Civic Data project. The online Open States tool lets you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Find your legislators</p></li>
      <li><p>Review their votes</p></li>
      <li><p>Search upcoming legislation</p></li>
      <li><p>Track bill progress</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data collection and structure behind Open States also provides a powerful API that other apps can use, like the Sunlight Foundation's notification tool, <a href="https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/">Scout</a>, which sends you an email every time there has been an action on a bill you are following.</p>

<h3>Types of Open Civic Data</h3>
<p class="intro">The power behind the Open Civic Data model is that it can be applied to every type of local legislative process, despite the differences in legislative processes across the country.  Below are common elements across all city legislative processes distilled&mdash;the more you collect the more you can share and compare:</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>People</h4>

    <p>Open Civic Data captures information about <strong>people</strong> involved in the legislative process, such as representatives or public officials. This can cover their names, positions, a photo, links, contact information and more.</p>
    <h4>Organizations</h4>

    <p>Open Civic Data captures information about civic <strong>organizations</strong>, such as committees. Organization entities may specify names and identifiers, contact information and the membership of the organization, along with other details.</p>
    <h4>Votes</h4>

    <p>Open Civic Data captures information about <strong>votes</strong>, such as who voted when and on what bill, plus additional details such as the type and sources of the vote information. Depending on the type of vote, vote counts and a list of individual legislators may be available.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>Events</h4>

    <p>Open Civic Data captures information about <strong>events</strong>, such as hearings and committee meetings. Events cover useful details such as start and and end times, location and items on an agenda.
